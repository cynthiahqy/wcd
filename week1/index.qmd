## What makes data open?

::: callout-important
Open data is measured by what it can be used for, not by how it is made
available.
:::

:::: callout-note
## Open Data Considerations 

::: incremental

-   **Use limitations:** No limitations that prevent particular uses. 

-   **Use limitations:** Anyone free to use, modify, combine and share, even commercially.

-   **Data cost:** Free to use does not mean that it must be free to access.

-   **Data cost:** Cost to creating, maintaining and publishing usable data.

-   **Data cost:** Live data and big data can incur ongoing costs.

-   **Reuse:** Free to use, reuse and redistribute it - even commercially.

:::
::::

## Definition open data

::: callout-important
Open data can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any
purpose
:::

:::: callout-note
## Two types of data openness:

::: incremental
-   The data must be legally open, which means they must be placed in
    the public domain or under liberal terms of use with minimal
    restrictions.

-   The data must be technically open, which means they must be
    published in electronic formats that are machine readable and
    non-proprietary, so that anyone can access and use the data using
    common, freely available software tools. Data must also be publicly
    available and accessible on a public server, without password or
    firewall restrictions. [^2]

## Why do we need open data?

::: callout-important 

**Help make governments more transparent.**

-   Open data allowed citizens in Canada to save the government billions
    in fraudulent charitable donations

**Building new business opportunities**

-   Transport for London has released open data that developers have
    used to build over 800 transport apps.

**Protecting the planet**

-   Open data can supoort early warning systems for
    environmental disasters
-   Open data is also helping consumers to understand their personal impacts on the environment

:::

## Why license open data?

::: callout-important
-   Licences tells people how they can access, use and share data.
:::

::: callout-note 
## Licenses 

-   Without a licence, users may find themselves in a legal grey area.
    Data may be 'publicly available', but users may not have permission
    to access, use and share it under general copyright or database
    laws.

-   An open data licence is an explicit permission to use the data for
    both commercial and non-commercial purposes.

-   Open data publishers should provide easy access to the licence for
    all datasets that are available to access, use and share.

-   Organisations and governments use Open Data licenses to clearly
    explain the conditions under which their data may be used.
    
:::

## Open data licenses

:::callout-tip
## TLDR 

Many licenses include both a summary version, intended to convey the most important concepts to all users, and a detailed version that provides the complete legal foundation.

:::

:::callout-note 
## Examples include

-   Standard re-usable license: consistent and broadly recognized terms
    of use
    -   Creative Commons, particularly CC-By and CC0
        https://creativecommons.org/
    -   Open Database License https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/
-   Bespoke licenses: governments and international organizations
    developed
    -   UK Open Government License
        http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/
    -   The World Bank Terms of Use
        https://data.worldbank.org/summary-terms-of-use

:::

## Quick comment 

:::callout-tip 
## Licence type 

* Standard licenses can offer several advantages over bespoke licenses.

* Standard licences have 
greater recognition among users, increased interoperability,
and greater ease of compliance.

## Machine Readable

::: callout-warning
'machine readable' is not synonymous with 'digitally accessible'

Historical efforts have focused on: 
    -   pushing static information about government programs and
        services to the web,
    -   where the intended use is a human who can read, print, and take
        actions based on reading.
    -   It's a narrow vision of the expected users and uses of the
        information.
:::

## Machine Readable

:::callout-note 
## Machine Readable 

-   Machine readable formats expand field of vision to new users and new
    uses and require technologies like XML and JSON
    -   üòø PDF is not suitably machine readable
    -   üòÄ CSV (or XLSX, XLS) is common, and universally accessible, but
        should be structured for analysis not for reading
    -   üò∏ XML, JSON is verbose, can contain metadata, but needs special
        readers
    -   ü§© API provides an interface that other software can utilise to
        automatically extract and process

## FAIR principles for scientific data

Learn more at [fair.org]( https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/)

:::callout-note
## FAIR Principles 

:::incremental 
o
* **Findable** Metadata and data should be easy to find for both humans and computers. 
Machine-readable metadata are
essential for automatic discovery of datasets and services.

* **Accessible** Once the user finds the required data,
they need to know how can they accessed that data, possibly including
authentication and authorisation.

* **Interoperable** The
data usually need to be integrated with other data. In addition, the data need to interoperate with applications or workflows for analysis,
storage, and processing.

* **Reusable** The ultimate goal
of FAIR is to optimise the reuse of data. To achieve this, metadata and
data should be well-described so that they can be replicated and/or
combined in different settings.

## Publishing data

:::callout-tip 
## Publishing Your Data 

- Research data is increasingly seen as part of the corpus of scholarly publications.  

- Publishers, funders and governments support researchers to publish their data outputs by various policies, guidelines and mandates.

-   Obtaining a Digital Object Identifier system (DOI) provides a
    persistent identifier, and can be used for data. Two services in
    Australia:
    -   [Australian Research Data Commons
        (ARDC)](https://ardc.edu.au/services/identifier/) can generate a
        DOI for you.
    -   [Australian National Data
        Service](https://www.ands.org.au/online-services/doi-service)
-   Many open data sets provide information on how to cite them, when
    used in other forms of publication.

- See more guidelines at
[ARDS](https://www.ands.org.au/working-with-data/publishing-and-reusing-data/publishing)
and [ARDC](https://ardc.edu.au/services/research-data-australia/).

## Legal requirements: 

* Protect sensitive
information like personal data
* Preserve the rights of data owners 
* Promote correct use of the data

:::

:::callout-caution
## Practical requirements: 

If you provide a link to the data on a website:
* Update the data regularly if it changes 
* Commit to continue
to make the data available

::: 

:::callout-caution
## Technical requirements: 

* Think about the format in which the data is published 
* The structure of the data 
* The channels through which
the data is available

:::

## Common pitfalls with open data

:::callout-warning 
## Watch out for: 

-   Mixed date formats american/european
-   Multiple representations differences in abbreviations,
    capitalisation, spacing
-   Duplicate records
-   Redundant data
-   Mixed numerical scales
-   Spelling errors

## Long shelf life, highly processed

- Convenient, but contains unhealthy ingredients, and is a bad habit
- eg iris, mtcars, titanic, handwritten digits
- Found at eg [UCI Machine learning archive](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php)

## Synthetic

-   Used primarily these days for privacy protection
-   Correct up to the model used to simulate the data - misses
    interesting structure in data not captured by model
-   Very pretty, very consistent, but it can burn you
-   eg [OECD Programme for International Student
    Assessment](https://www.oecd.org/pisa/data/) A generalised linear
    model is fitted to the scores, with predictors such as school,
    gender, ... Model is used to simulate a score for each student.

## Wild

- Fresh, interesting, exciting

- But also challenging! 

- Real world data sets, with real world messiness

- eg [US Bureau of Transportation Statistics air traffic database](https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DL_SelectFields.asp?Table_ID=236)

## Fresh and local

-   Best kind of wild data

- Collected locally, and about  our own lives

-   eg [Melbourne pedestrian
    counts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rwalkr/index.html)

## Wild-caught data 

:::: callout-important
## Our working definition

**Wild caught data** is:

::: incremental
-   data the can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any
    purpose, AND

-   The data source is traceable, the data collection is transparent,
    and the data is updated as new measurements arrive, AND

-   In case of data processing, the process is clearly described and
    reproducible.
:::
::::

## What about your favourite datasets?

:::: callout-important
## Are they Wild?

::: incremental
-   `r emo::ji("check")` Freely available to be used and modified

-   `r emo::ji("check")` Can be shared

-   `r emo::ji("check")` Data provenance is clear

-   `r emo::ji("check")` How the data was collected is transparent

-   `r emo::ji("check")` Data is updated as new measurements become
    available

-   `r emo::ji("check")` Any processing of this data is clear

## Summary

:::: callout-note
## Open data: definitions, sources and examples

::: incremental

- Introduced you to the Open Data Fundamentals  
*eg. power for societal good, where to access, limitations, licences*

- Data Quality Elements   
*eg. meta data, machine readable, FAIR, five star ratings*

- Wild Caught Data Meaning  
*and other flavours of open data*

- Teaching philosophy of cake first!

## Learning R

::: callout-note
## Getting set up

-   By the end of this unit you'll be performing your own analytics case
    studies

-   Before you can do that we need to get you set up with the software
    you'll use in this unit

-   We'll now go through the steps to install R and RStudio

-   Think about R as the engine and RStudio as the dashboard and
    controls.

-   We need both to drive a car.
:::

## Installing R and RStudio

We'll open RStudio to create data visualisations using R.

::: callout-note
## Step 1: Install R

-   Got to https://www.r-project.org/
-   Click "download R"
-   Select a mirror (I use the Melbourne one)
-   Install for your operating system
:::

::: callout-note
## Step 2: Install RStudio

-   Got to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/ (you only
    need the free version)
-   Select download for your system
-   Follow the prompts to install
:::

## But Why?

::: callout-note
## Why do we need a Programming Language

-   It allows us to have reproducible steps, which can be applied for
    many different data sets

-   Make sure the analysis is not just point and click, you can work as
    a team on it on the same code

-   It also means we can more easily create our own bespoke
    visualisations
:::

::: callout-note
## Why do we use R?

-   It has been around for a while.

-   It is regularly maintained and is open source.

-   It is beginner friendly

-   Even if you use other languages, you might still use R for your data
    visualisations
:::

## Getting Started in R

:::: callout-note
## Learning a new language is hard!

::: incremental
-   You need to think about grammar and structure, and how to
    communicate well in it!

-   You will make mistakes, lots of them.

-   Below you see code that plots points showing the GDP per capita
    against life expectancy. The points are coloured by country and the
    size of the points shows the population.

-   It might look impossible now, but by the end of this semester you
    will be able to write this yourself!
:::
::::

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
plot <- ggplot(data = gapminder) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, size = pop, colour = country)) + 
  theme(legend.position = "none")
plot 
```
