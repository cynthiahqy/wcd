# Philosophically

Think about this unit in the way Dr Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel describes in this talk: 

["Let them eat cake (first)"](https://speakerdeck.com/minecr/let-them-eat-cake-first-b18397a2-9fbd-4bd8-b4b5-a31600c02870?slide=2)

<br><br><br>
Imagine you're .monash-blue2[new to baking], and you're in a baking class. 

I'm going to present two options for starting the class. .monash-orange2[Which one gives you better sense of the final product?]
