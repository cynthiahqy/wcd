# Time has come to wrap up this unit

Suppose you are the data curator. What should you know?

<br><br><center>

.aim-box.tl.w-70[
Today you will learn:

- About organising data into spreadsheets for analysis
- Rules for caring and feeding your data
- Realistic guide to making data available

We will also discuss SETUs and Assignment 4 today.

# Back in week 1 ...

We learnt **OPEN DATA** is a raw material for the digital age but, 

unlike coal, timber or diamonds, 

it can be used by anyone and everyone at the same time.

# Results published in The Lancet

-An article in The Lancet, "found Covid-19 patients who received the malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, were dying at higher rates and experiencing more heart-related complications than other virus patients". 
<br>

--

-The Lancet is *one of the oldest and best known journals* that publishes general medical articles,
<br>

--

-Within days, the World Health Organization had halted its support for trials of hydroxychloroquine. 
<br>

--

-Australian infectious disease researchers began questioning the published results very quickly. 

---

# Something fishy

-*The data the researchers used to draw their conclusions in the Lancet article is not readily available in Australian clinical databases*
<br>

--

-This lead many to ask where the data came from? 
<br>

--

-The numbers for the Australian cases did not match the data that researchers here knew. 
<br>

--

-Most journals require the data and software to be made available so that others can verify the results. This is becoming more and more the standard.
<br><br>

--

.idea-box.tl.w-70[

So the Australian infectious disease specialists made some phone calls ...

]

---

# Hello, can I ask you about your data?

The first call was to the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System, who confirmed that they were not the source of the data. 
<br>

--

Next to health departments in NSW and Victoria, who also confirmed that they did not provide the data. 
<br>

--

And then to the hospitals themselves
<br>

--

Which prompted this response 
<br>

*Dr Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor with Alfred Health in Melbourne, said the Australian hospitals involved in the study should be named. He said he had never heard of Surgisphere, and no one from his hospital, The Alfred, had provided Surgisphere with data. "Usually to submit to a database like Surgisphere you need ethics approval, and someone from the hospital will be involved in that process to get it to a database," he said. He said the dataset should be made public, or at least open to an independent statistical reviewer. If they got this wrong, what else could be wrong?" Cheng said.*

Replace "science" with "data science", "data analysis", "analytics", "business intelligence". 

- keep careful track of versions of data and code
- to be fully reproducible, then *provenance* information is a must 
    - working pipeline analysis code, 
    - a platform to run it on, and
    - verifiable versions of the data. 
- what types of re-use do you think others might make of your work?

# Reward Colleagues Who Share Their Data Properly

- Build promotion and award systems that count data and code-sharing activities.
- Consider this activity an important part of your own data science work.
