## What is the Australian census? 

.flex[

* The first Australian census was held in 1911. 
{{content}}
]
.w-50.center[
&lt;img src="images/lecture-07/census-form.png" width = "70%"/&gt;

]]

* Since 1961, the census occurs **every 5 years** in Australia  
{{content}}

&lt;br&gt;

--

* The next census is in 2026.
{{content}}
&lt;br&gt;

--

* Counts **every person and household** in Australia.  
*(well almost everyone, the 2021 census had a 96% participation rate but that is very high.)*
{{content}}

&lt;br&gt;

--

* Comprehensive snapshot of the country and **tells the story of how we are changing**. 
{{content}}

&lt;br&gt;

--

* The Australia Bureau of Statistics (ABS) is legislated to collect and disseminate census data under the *ABS Act 1975* and *Census and Statistics Act 1905*. 
{{content}}

--

* For more details refer to the [ (ABS) Website](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/about-census/australian-census).

# What is the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS)? 

.flex[
.w-65[

* ABS is the independent statistical agency of the Government of Australia. 
{{content}}

]
.w-30.center[



&lt;img src="images/lecture-07/Australian_Bureau_of_Statistics_logo.svg"/&gt;

]]

--

* If you are from outside Australia, find the statistical government agency in your country &lt;i class="fas fa-wrench gray"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, e.g. 
  * in 🇯🇵 Japan, this is the [Statistics Bureau of Japan](https://www.stat.go.jp/english/),
  * in 🇨🇳 China, the [National Bureau of Statistics of China](http://www.stats.gov.cn/english/),
  * in 🇮🇳 India, the [Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation](https://www.mospi.gov.in/), and
  * in 🇳🇿 New Zealand, the [Statistics New Zealand](https://www.stats.govt.nz/).

{{content}}
--

* ABS provides key statistics on a wide range of economic, population, environmental and social issues, to assist and encourage informed decision making, research and discussion within governments and the community.

---

## Why do we do a census? 

* The census is not cheap to do. The 2021 census **cost of $565 million**. That's roughly $22 per person.

&lt;br&gt;

--

* However the **census provides value for money and it is important**.

&lt;br&gt;

--

* An [independent report](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/about-census/value-census) found that for every `$`1 invested in the Census, `$`6 of value is generated to the Australian economy.

&lt;br&gt;

--

* The census **data tells us about the economic, social and cultural** make-up of the country.

&lt;br&gt;

--

* Need census **data to make decisions and plan for the future** 

&lt;br&gt;

--

* It informs planning for schools, health care, transport and infrastructure. It is also used to help plan local services for individuals, families and communities.

---

## How is the census conducted? 

The ABS contacts households in a few different ways:

* **Letters and paper forms are delivered** in some areas
* In other areas, **visits were made to households**. 

&lt;br&gt;

--

Then households complete the Census form, either submitting it online or sending it back in the mail.

&lt;br&gt;

--

**ABS provides a range of supports and resources to help everyone to fill in the census**. 

&lt;br&gt;

--

.question-box.w-85[
Take a moment to think about .monash-blue[**what challenges might arise if you try to survey everyone**].  

*Hint: Think about smaller communities, their sub-groups and their different needs.*
 
]


---

## How can we survey everyone?

It is no small task! 

* Resources for people in the deaf/hard of hearing and blind/low vision communities  
*e.g. audio guides and braille information packs*

&lt;br&gt;
--

* To support Aboriginal and Torres Straight Islanders to fill in the census there are urban and regional pop-up hubs. 
*This includes extra face-to-face support*

&lt;br&gt;
--

* For migrants, refugees, and international visitors there are language supports available.

&lt;br&gt;
--

* Additional efforts are made to survey in locations to reach without a fixed address  
*e.g. FIFO workers (Fly in Fly Out), Grey Nomads, People experiencing homelessness.*

# Getting the ABS Census Data 

## .animated.flash[&lt;i class="fas fa-database"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data]

There are two main types of data that you can download:

* **DataPacks** &lt;i class="fas fa-download"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/datapacks
* **GeoPackages** &lt;i class="fas fa-download"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; https://www.abs.gov.au/census/find-census-data/geopackages


&lt;img src="images/lecture-07/datapack-download.png" width = "70%"/&gt;

---

# Navigating ABS Census data

* DataPacks are only available for the 2011, 2016 and 2021 census.

--

* ABS aims for **census data to be comparable and compatible with previous censuses**. 

--

* Questions and classifications are reviewed to reflect changes in the Australian society.  
*e.g. In 2021, ABS did not to ask about home internet connection as people now have other options like mobile devices and that data was no longer considered relevant to society.*

--
* There are small differences in the available data between years.  
*Variables can be added, updated and removed.*

--
* There are also sometimes [data corrections](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/2021-census-data-corrections) at a later date.

* Here are links to:   
[(i) what's new in 2021](https://www.abs.gov.au/census/guide-census-data/census-dictionary/2021/whats-new-2021) - there were 56 new additions!

## Reality of any data analysis 

&lt;br&gt;

&lt;div class="idea-box"&gt;
Navigating data and deducing what it is often requires you to do some &lt;b&gt;"detective work"&lt;/b&gt; 🕵️‍♀️&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br&gt;

--

* Much like real detective work, **just locating the data and understanding the data variables can take a long time**

&lt;br&gt;

--

* **Cleaning and wrangling of the data is not glamorous**;   
There's far more attention in "catching criminals" / praise for the cool discoveries from statistical analysis.

We need some description or understanding of the variables.  
*It will be near impossible to extract meaningful information from the data without it.*

.idea-box.tl.w-80[
## Breakout Session

Then take some time to review the read me and the meta data folders.  

* Which folder contains demographic information about each suburb?  

* What is LGA short for?  

* Where can I find information about how much rent people pay?  

* What is contained in variable G17?  

]
&lt;/center&gt;

---

# Table G17

There are few things to note:

* There are 201 columns in G17A and G17B and 81 columns in G17C. 

* Perhaps there is an export limitation for a data that contains more than 200 columns, thus it is broken up into different csv files.  

* Which means that you have to join the tables G17A, G17B and G17C as one  
*(you'll do this in the tutorial &lt;i class="fas fa-wrench gray"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;)*.

# Tidy Data

# What is Tidy Data?

&lt;br&gt;

.info-box[

## Tidy Data Principles

1. Each variable must have its own column
2. Each observation must have its own row
3. Each value must have its own cell
]

{{content}}


.footnote[
Wickham (2014) Tidy Data. *Journal of Statistical Software* **59**
]

--

So what about the ABS Census Data?

* The table header in fact contains information!
* E.g. &lt;span class="monash-blue2"&gt;`F_400_499_15_19_yrs`&lt;/span&gt; is female aged 15-19 years old who earn $400-499 per week (in Victoria).
* The number in the cells are the **counts**.
* Is the data tidy?

---

# Tidying the ABS 2016 Census Data

* Ideally we want the data to look like:

&lt;br&gt;


```
##   age_min age_max gender income_min income_max count
## 1      15      19 female        400        499  4020
```

* Putting data into a tidy format makes the data analysis easier.

* You can include other information, e.g. geography code (useful if combining with other geographical area) or average age/income.

* Note some categories do not have upper bounds, e.g. .monash-blue[`M_3000_more_85ov`]. In R, `-Inf` and `Inf` are used to represent `\(-\infty\)` and `\(\infty\)`, respectively.  

* You'll wrangle the data into the tidy form in tutorial  &lt;i class="fas fa-wrench gray"&gt;&lt;/i&gt;

* This will require getting the pieces of information from the column names and organising them using string manipulation.

---

class: transition

# Manipulating strings 

---

# Manipulating strings 

* The `stringr` package provides a set of functions designed to help with string manipulation.


```r
library(tidyverse) # includes `stringr`
```

.footnote.f5[
Hadley Wickham (2019). stringr: Simple, Consistent Wrappers for
  Common String Operations. R package version 1.4.0.
  
Gagolewski M. and others (2020). R package stringi: Character
  string processing facilities.
]

--

* Main functions in `stringr` begin with the **prefix with `str_`**  and the first input into the functions is a string (or a vector of strings)

--

* What do you think `str_trim` and `str_squish` do?

```r
str_trim(c("    Apple ", "  Goji    Berry     "))
```

```
## [1] "Apple"         "Goji    Berry"
```

```r
str_squish(c("    Apple ", "  Goji    Berry     "))
```

```
## [1] "Apple"      "Goji Berry"
```

* [Click here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/strings.pdf) for a cheat sheet for `stringr` functions.

---

## Some other examples

These are `stringr` functions we'll need for our census application.

Splitting strings by a pattern:


```r
str_split(string = "Hi_everyone_in_ETC5512", pattern = "_")
```

```
## [[1]]
## [1] "Hi"       "everyone" "in"       "ETC5512"
```
Replacing parts of strings with a different pattern:


```r
str_replace(string = "we_want_fourwords", pattern = "rw", replace = "r_w")
```

```
## [1] "we_want_four_words"
```

Deleting parts of strings that aren't imporant: 


```r
str_remove(string = "we_want_to_remove_the_extra_stuff", pattern = "to_remove_the_extra_")
```

```
## [1] "we_want_stuff"
```

To get more control over the kinds of patterns we can match, we need regular expressions.

# Regular expressions .font_small[.font_small[Part] 1]

## Weird characters

Characters we use to define the regex, e.g. *,.,!,?,),] need to be defined differently when we are trying to match them.

This doesn't work:

```r
str_extract("Let's get the character and the brackets (A)", "([:alpha:])")
```

```
## [1] "L"
```

```r
str_view("Let's get the character and the brackets (A)", "([:alpha:])")
```

```
## [1] │ &lt;L&gt;&lt;e&gt;&lt;t&gt;'&lt;s&gt; &lt;g&gt;&lt;e&gt;&lt;t&gt; &lt;t&gt;&lt;h&gt;&lt;e&gt; &lt;c&gt;&lt;h&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;r&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;t&gt;&lt;e&gt;&lt;r&gt; &lt;a&gt;&lt;n&gt;&lt;d&gt; &lt;t&gt;&lt;h&gt;&lt;e&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;r&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;c&gt;&lt;k&gt;&lt;e&gt;&lt;t&gt;&lt;s&gt; (&lt;A&gt;)
```
But this does. 

```r
str_extract("Let's get the character and the brackets (A)", "\\([:alpha:]\\)" )
```

```
## [1] "(A)"
```
To match a bracket `(` we need to use `\\(` in stringr. 
It tells R we are looking for the bracket as part of the pattern and not to look for the backslash. The same goes for other special characters:

# Raw Data vs. Aggregated Data

* Although the data collected was from individual households, with each person in the household surveyed (see sample form [here](https://www.abs.gov.au/system/files/documents/12486ae64f0f0ea2d056ee6aa54adc34/Sample%202021%20Census%20Household%20Form%20%5B1.1MB%5D.pdf)), the downloaded data are .monash-blue[**aggregated**].
* Aggregate data presents summary statistics from the .monash-blue[**raw data**]. 
*(e.g. a common summary statistic is the mean)*. 
* When the summary statistics are counts then it is often called .monash-blue[**frequency data**].
* The raw data collected would be similar to the form

<div class="datatables html-widget html-fill-item-overflow-hidden html-fill-item" id="htmlwidget-0494992d3a04bee8ec55" style="width:100%;height:auto;"></div>

# What you lose in aggregate data

* For aggregate data, there are less scope for you to draw insights conditioned on other variables.   
* *e.g. Based on frequency data alone, you cannot answer questions like: How many middle income families have 2 children?*
* Raw data are desirable if you can get hold of it!
--


## Trust and skepticism


* By the way, did you notice anything odd about the dummy data presented in the last slide?
--



* John Smith was recorded as female and Jane Smith as male. Data may have been incorrectly recorded. 
--



* How much do you trust the aggregate data?

--

* Remember to have a healthy dose of skepticism in your data.


---

# Data Confidentiality

* The data is not just aggregated, but it is also .monash-blue[anonymised]
* E.g. in .monash-blue[`2021_GCP_Sequential_Template_R2.xlsx`], Sheet "G17", footnote says "*Please note that there are **small random adjustments** made to all cell values to protect the confidentiality of data. These adjustments may cause the sum of rows or columns to differ by small amounts from table totals.*"

.question-box.w-60[
Do you think that you'll get the same numbers if you use the ones from different geographical code? E.g. `SA1` and `STE`.

--

* You can check this in the tutorial 🔧

## Summary

* We went through how to locate and understand the data available in the 2021 Australian census.
* We know some limitations with this data. 
* We learnt about what tidy data is.
* We learnt a little about how to manipulate strings

## Answers to break out questions

* Which folder contains demographic information about each suburb?  
*In the file `2021AboutDataPacks_readme.txt` you find out that folders represent different geographical sub-regions. SAL represents suburbs and locaties and in the previous census was called SSC.* 

* What is LGA short for?    
*Local Government Areas*

* Where can I find information about how much rent people pay?  
*In the file `2021_GCP_Sequential_Template_R2` there is a list of variables and what is contained in each table. G40 contains the rental information (organised by landlord type).*

* What is contained in variable G17?  
*G17 contains information about the total personal income organised by age and sex.*

&lt;li&gt;This is a pattern expressed as &lt;b&gt;regular expression&lt;/b&gt; or &lt;b&gt;regex&lt;/b&gt; for short&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Note in R, you have to add an extra &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; when  &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; is included in the pattern &lt;span class="font_small"&gt;(yes this means that you can have a lot of backslashes... just keep adding &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; until it works! Enjoy &lt;a href="https://xkcd.com/1638/"&gt;this xkcd comic&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

{{content}}

--

&lt;li&gt;From R v4.0.0 onwards, you can use raw string to elimiate all the extra &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt;, e.g. &lt;code&gt;r"(&lt;span class="monash-blue"&gt;\(.+\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;)"&lt;/code&gt; is the same as &lt;code class="monash-blue"&gt;"\\(.+\\)"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

* `"[]"` for single character match
* We want to match `(` and `)` but these are meta-characters
* So we need to escape it to have it as a literal: `\(` and `\)`
* But we must escape the escape character... so it's actually `\\(` `\\)`
