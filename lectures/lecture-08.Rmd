# Ethical Perspectives (School of Ethics)

1. Deontological Ethics (Immanuel Kant)
  * an ethical theory that says actions are good or bad according to a clear .red[set of rules].
  * Most can be explained by Kant theory (Immanuel Kant)
  * Focus on rights, principles, and duties
  * Preserve human autonomy and dignity, justice, fairness, transparency and many more. However, they can conflict with each other sometimes üòü
  * This dignity creates an ethical that prevents us from acting in certain ways either toward other people or toward ourselves
  * Rules should apply to everyone (universal ethical rules)

--

.idea-box[
* How might the dignity and fairness of each stakeholder be impacted by your project?  
* Is there any trust and justice are relevant to your project?  
* Does your project involve any conflicting moral duties to the participants or stakeholder rights?
]

???

Its name comes from the Greek word deon, meaning duty. Actions that align with these rules are ethical, while actions that don‚Äôt aren‚Äôt. https://ethics.org.au/ethics-explainer-deontology/

# Ethical Perspectives (School of Ethics)

2\. Consequentialist ethics and utilitarianism 
  * Consider the .red[outcomes] rather than the intentions
  * Two main examples of consequentialism: utilitarianism, hedonism
  * Utilitarianism judges consequences by a .red[greatest good for the greatest number] standard. 
  * Hedonism considers something is ‚Äúgood‚Äù if the consequence produces .red[pleasure] or avoids pain.

--
.idea-box[
* Which option will produce the most good and do the least harm?  
* Which option will best serves the community as a whole?
* For example: let‚Äôs suppose we will know the cause of a cancer and would cure million of patients, if we just have to sacrifice 1% of the cancer patient for the study.

# Ethical Perspectives (School of Ethics)

3\. Virtue Based Ethics (Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, Mencius)
  * Virtue ethics is a philosophy developed by Aristotle and other ancient Greeks 
  * It is the quest to understand and live a life of moral character and well-cultivated
  * Act in a way to be a better person (culturally based)
  * The same aim can lead to conflicting actions

#Why consider ethical data practices?

* Data is increasingly accessible and available
  * Can use for understanding our world
  * Can use to make decisions (data driven decision making)
  * Can use to inform policy decisions
--

* Research ethics is often discussed in experimental settings
  * The fundamental ethical concerns do not change
--

* Data has an increasing impact on our lives
  * Data for good initiatives
  * Unethical uses of data
  * Open data increases the reach of data but risks privacy


---
# Data Ethics

* Ethics behind data science ranges from data acquisition to modeling  

--
* Data science models affect everyone of us:
  * getting a job 
  * loan application
  * dating
  * social life
  * buying car insurance  
  * medical report  
  
--
* Data is constantly being collected; facebook track our voice while we .orange[open the app], .orange[social media studying our click and like], .orange[mobile app tracks your location and time], .red[cameras are everywhere] and the list goes on and on...

# Application of ethics for data scientist

1. Ethics on data
  * make sure data has informed consent from the participants
  * read the term and conditions
  * privacy screening has been done

--

2. Ethics on models/algorithm
  * make sure training data is representative  
  * past population is not representative of the future population  
  * algorithm that imposed fairness (no discrimination on any individual and aggregate outcome)


---
# Belmont report (1979)

--

* It was written by the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research.    

--
* It was created under the National Research Act of 1974.

--
* Identifies basic ethical principles and guidelines that address ethical issues arising from the conduct of reaseach with human subject  

--
* Application to demonstrate the use of these principles

# What constitutes as research?

.blockquote[
**Research**  
"an activity designed to test an hypothesis, permit conclusions to be drawn, and thereby to develop or contribute to generalizable knowledge
"
]
--
.blockquote[
**Practice**  
"interventions that are designed solely to enhance the well-being of an individual patient or client and that have a reasonable expectation of success"
]

#Basic Ethical Principles
.info-box.w-100[
Autonomy is about being able to deliberate and make personal goals, and then act upon them
]

1. Respect for Persons
 * Acknowledge and respect autonomy
 * Protect those with diminished autonomy
--
 
2. Beneficence
 * Do not cause harm
 * Minimize possible harms and maximise possible benefits
--
 
3. Justice
  * Who ought to receive the benefits of research and bear its burdens?


.footnote[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html#xbound

]

---
# Applications

1. Informed consent
  * Participants have a right to understand what is going to happen
  * Application of respect for persons
  
--

2. Assessment of Risks and Benefits
  * Are the risks justified?
  * Is the study well designed?
  * Are there alternative lower risk designs possible?
  * Are potential benefits and risks communicated to participants?
  * Application of beneficence
  
.footnote[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html#xbound

# Applications

3\. Selection of Subjects
  * Fairly offer research participation to all eligible 
  * Some subjects preferred to as best able to bear risk (e.g., adults)
  * "injustice arises from social, racial, sexual and cultural biases institutionalized in society"
  * Careful not to overburden vulnerable subjects

# Data Protection Laws and Regulations 

* **Australia:** Privacy Act 1988, which includes the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) -- principal data protection legislation.  

--
* **Europe:** General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) adopted by the European Parliament which regulates "personal data". 
    * Passed in 2018 to provide strong protection on the collections, use and management of data
    * Rights of the individual
      * Information and access - you can access your data and see how it is processed
      * Right to request erasure of data
  * In Australia, need to comply if you offer goods and services in EU, collect data from EU individuals or are established in the EU

# General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

* one of the most influential data privacy regulations until today. 
* It defines 8 user rights under the law. IT serve as existing legal principles.  
  * The right to be informed. 
  * The right of access. 
  * The right to rectification. 
  * The right to erasure. 
  * The right to restrict processing. 
  * The right to data portability. 
  * The right to object. 
  * The right to avoid automated decision-making.

# Your turn
.question-box.w-100[
A study investigates whether there has been an increased occurrence in loneliness during the COVID-19 lockdowns in Melbourne, Australia. The research method uses a survey administered during lockdown and non-lockdown periods to measure participant loneliness. What is one potential risk? How could this risk be minimized/managed/monitored? Are there benefits that justify this risk?
]

--

* **RISK:** Respondents reports extreme psychological stress
--

* **BENEFIT:** Understanding loneliness patterns can assist in providing preventitive and other mental health services
--

* **MITIGATION/MANAGEMENT:** Respondents are given a list of freely available mental health services to use if needed at the end of the study.

# Consent

.info-box.w-100[
**Belmont Report**
* Information
* Comprehension
* Voluntary (without cohersion)
]
--
.info-box.w-100[
**National Statement on ethical conduct in research involving humans**
"...consent should be a voluntary choice, and should
be based on sufficient information and adequate
understanding of both the proposed research and
the implications of participation in it."
]



---
# Justice, data sources and representation

* From the Belmont report we see that justice relates to the risks/benefits of the study at the same probability for all participants 
--

* They also note the need to be careful not to exhaust vulnerable populations by overstudying. 
--

* Big datasets often have challenges of representation - not everyone in the population has an equal chance of representation
--

* This can be one cause of biased predictions and unfair algorithms - the algorithms are less accurate for particular subsets of the population
--

* However, much of big data doesn't cost the participant to give - it's created through scraping etc, and the lack of representation reflects sociological and cultural power imbalances

---
#Your turn

.question-box.w-100[
A large company surveys all of their current employees, measuring demographics and
personality factors. They hope to identify key personality factors that correspond with
a successful time with the company. Their hope is to use this data to identify which
prospective employees they should hire. 
]

--

* Are there any concerns with the data source?
--

* Using existing employee data reinforces any previous discriminatory hiring patterns

--
.info-box.w-100[
Counterfactual: What would have happened if we hired people who were different to those previously hired?]

# Focussing on statistical and data practices

* So far we've focused on ethical and data practice in research generally.
--

* The basic principles apply to ALL research, but many of the examples focus on experimental research 
--

* How can we translate this principles to a more statistical/data focus?

---

# Ethical guidelines for statisticians

.footnote[https://www.amstat.org/asa/files/pdfs/EthicalGuidelines.pdf]

1. Professional Integrity and Accountability
--

2. Integrity of data and method
--

3. Responsibilities to Science/Public/Funder/Client 
--

4. Responsibilities to Research Subjects
--

5. Responsibilities to Research Team Colleagues
--

6. Responsibilities to Other Statisticians or Statistics Practitioners
--

7. Responsibilities Regarding Allegations of Misconduct

---

### Alternative view

.footnote[Gelman (2018). Ethics in statistical practice and communication: Five recommendations. Significance]

1. Prioritize open data and methods
--

2. Be clear about the information and assumptions that go into statistical methods
--

3. Respect for data
--

4. Publication of criticisms 
--

5. Respect the limitations of statistics


---
# Yet another perspective

.footnote[https://deon.drivendata.org/]

* Much of what we spent the first half of the lecture discussing surrounds data collection and modeling
--

* Identify other areas including:
 * Storage 
 * Analysis 
 * Deployment
--

* These areas are less likely to be mentioned, but are equally important. 

---
# How to be an ethical data scientist

1. Firstly ensure that you are following the ethical frameworks of the company you are in (e.g., I work for Monash so I ensure that my research conforms to Australian standards through Monash procedures)
--

2. Ensure you understand the different areas where unethical thinking/practices can be introduced
--

3. Checklists like https://deon.drivendata.org/#default-checklist can be useful!
--

4. Keep learning and exploring different perspectives to you own 
---

# Summary 

.aim-box.tl.w-70[
What we learnt:

- Developed an understanding for data ethics principles
- Developed some checks and balances for any future analysis
- Started our journey to towards conducting ethical analytics
