## Today's lecture

::: callout-note
## What we'll cover:

::: incremental 

- We are going to get curious about US airline traffic

- Guide you to think about important variables in the data 

- Show you how others have gotten curious before you

- Answer our curious questions using data visualisation

# Case Study: US airline data {background-color="#006DAE"}

## US Airline Traffic Data

You can find the data [here](
 https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DataIndex.asp)

<center>
<img src="images/data-expo/BTS_website.png" />
</center>

## Download the data

:::callout-note 
## Steps 

- Navigate to the airline ontime performance data base by going to 
https://www.transtats.bts.gov/

- Select "Aviation" from left box

- Then select "Airline On-Time Performance Data" 

- In the table, find "Reporting Carrier On-Time Performance (1987-present)" click "Download"

- This will bring you to an interface for choosing a subset.

::: 

## Download the Data 

:::callout-warning 
## THE DATA IS VERY BIG!!! 

* Not all of it might be relevant to the question you want to answer 

* To start you might like to download a sample to understand what the data looks like 

::: 

## Download the Data 

If you were to download the data from the website - 

:::callout-note 
## Example

- Choose 2020 and January (before the pandemic hit the USA)

- Select these variables:  Year, Month, DayofMonth, DayOfWeek, FlightDate, Reporting_Airline, Tail_Number, Origin, Dest, CRSDepTime, DepTime, DepDelay, CRSArrTime, ArrTime, ArrDelay. 

- Click the "Download" button to get it onto your laptop. (No need to check pre-zipped.) 

- The resulting file is about 50Mb, and the column names are slightly different from the form names, but recongisable as the requested variables: `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY_OF_MONTH`, `DAY_OF_WEEK`, `FL_DATE`, `OP_UNIQUE_CARRIER`, `TAIL_NUM`, `ORIGIN`, `DEST`, `CRS_DEP_TIME`, `DEP_TIME`, `DEP_DELAY`,`CRS_ARR_TIME`,`ARR_TIME`, `ARR_DELAY`

:::

## Sneak Peak 

Lucky for us there is an R package, `nycflights13`, with a sample of this data for us to take a quick look.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true

library(nycflights13)
data(airlines)
data(airports)
data(flights)
data(planes)
data(weather)
```

## What's in a row?

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

airlines[1, ]
flights[1, ]
airports[1, ]
planes[1, ]
```


## Important to share

:::callout-caution 
## Documenting and communicating

* There is a lag in records appearing on the site, can be several months

* There is a data dictionary that explains all the variables

* Links at bottom of the site tells you what web site collects about  you when you visit (Privacy Policy)

* There is no clear license or policy on usage - Hunt around and check! 

:::

## What would you be curious about? 

::: callout-tip
## Breakout discussion

**Remember: Start with a question**

- Decide what you be curious about? 

- Are the variables you need available in the data? 

- Loook at the meta data and the data dictionary. 

- Also take a *quick* look for a licence 

- Discuss what type of data collection is this? (e.g. experimental or observational? Census, survey sampling or occurrence?) 

- Discuss what is the population? And what does a representative sample look like?

# Motivation {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Motivation

American Statistical Association Statistical Graphics and Computing Sections [2009 Data Expo](https://community.amstat.org/jointscsg-section/dataexpo/dataexpo2009) provided all of the commercial flight records for air travel in the USA from October 1987 to April 2008 as part of a competition. 

<center>
<img src="images/data-expo/data-expo-prize-award.jpg" width="600px">
</center>

## About the competition data

::::{.columns}

:::{.column width=50%}

* nearly 120 million records
* 12Gb of space uncompressed
* 1.6Gb compressed

The data for the competition is still available because it was given a DOI: [https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7). `r emoji("cartwheel")`

:::

:::{.column width=50%}

Organisers provided instructions on how to set up an [**sqlite database**]{.monash-orange2}, and access from R.

<br><br>

Read about [accessing databases from R]{.monash-blue} at this [RStudio site](https://db.rstudio.com/databases/sqlite/) is a good starting place to read about working with a sqlite database.

## Questions provided

:::callout-note 
## What one could get curious about 
:::{.incremental}

- When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?
- Do older planes suffer more delays?
- How does the number of people flying between different locations change over time?
- How well does weather predict plane delays?
- Can you detect cascading failures as delays in one airport create delays in others? Are there critical links in the system?
- Participants could also decide for themselves what to analyse.

## Processing

:::callout-tip
## Breakout-discussion

**How would you start to process the data to answer ...**

:::{.incremental}

- When is the best time of day/day of week/time of year to fly to minimise delays?

- Are some carriers operating more efficiently?

- Do some carriers operate more broadly than others?

- Do older planes suffer more delays?

## What is in your data?

Its good practice to show a useful view of entire data, to get a rough sense of major patterns.

:::callout-tip 
## Think about

* [Temporal trend:]{style="color: "#006DAE";} A major component of this data is traffic patterns over time.

* [Spatial pattern:]{style="color: "#006DAE";} Airports are distributed across the country, explore how the traffic operates relative to this geography.

* [Carriers:]{style="color: "#006DAE";} Are some carriers operating more widely, or more efficiently?

## Think about the steps

As we work through the summary plots, think about:

:::incremental 

- what needs to be done to the data to get to this summary

- what do you learn from each display, what's expected, what's surprising

- what other ways might the same information be presented, or other calculations made

:::

## Traffic patterns over time{.smaller}

<center>
<img src="images/data-expo/airlines_volume.jpg"  style="width: 1100px; box-shadow: 1px 1px 5px 10px #888888;"/>
</center>

Number of flights in millions per year: steadily increasing volume until 2001, with a big drop in 2002. Volume recovered in 2003, and flattens 2004-7, with another drop in 2008. What happened in 2001? What was happening in 2008?

## Deeper look: 

If you want to look at what tools were used and why you can review the following [paper site](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/suppl/10.1198/jcgs.2011.3de?scroll=top).

It contains a subset of the analysis materials including data and code for downloading.

<!-- - sqlite database: Inspired by the guidelines provided by the organisers we created a `mysql` database, on a central server that all team members could access with a password. Each person accessed the data through R. -->
<!-- - R packages: `RMySQL`, `DBI`, `ggplot2` -->

<!-- <!-- TODO: Removed database stuff from here --> 

# Summary {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Working with wild data

:::callout-tip 
## Working with wild data can be daunting!

:::incremental 

1. Start with questions that might be answered using the data.

2. Map out a pipeline to process the data, to address the question.

3. Think about what might be expected, so results can be "externally validated".

## Summary

:::: callout-note
## First Case Study

::: incremental

- Generated insights from wild data! 

- Reviewed two approaches to the same data set 

- Saw the beauty of working with wild data - Same data, different approaches, different insights!

:::
:::

::: callout-caution 
## For your Assignment:

::: incremental

- Saw an example of documenting your download process 

- Discussed what a representative sample would be in this example

- Discussed how we would need to process our data to answer our questions 

- Importantly considered data collection and data limitations. In this example, watch out for Ghost Flights!
