## Understanding the population

::: callout-important
Collecting data on the entire population is normally too expensive or
infeasible!
:::

:::: callout-note
::: incremental
-   If we can collect data on the entire population it is called a
    [census]{style="color:#FF8200;"}

-   Often only collect data only on a subset of the population.

-   **So how should we sample the population?**

-   There are many sampling schemes!
:::
::::

# Sampling {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Why sample

<br><br>

::: callout-note
## Goal of a sampling scheme

We want to get accurate information from the sample in order to answer
your question about the population.
:::

## When sampling think about

:::: callout-warning
## Think!!!

Accurate sampling involves identifying:

::: incremental
-   The **population of interest** (e.g. if studying about male baldness
    pattern, your population of interest is the biologically male
    population),

-   what **responses** (dependent variables) or **covariates**
    (explanatory or independent or predictor variables) to capture and
    how to measure it (e.g. do you collect their age? Which range of age
    they are in? Their hair count? The thickness of the hair?),

-   the **sample size** (how many samples do we need?),

-   any **structure** that will be in the data (e.g. population
    structures, repeated cross-sectional data, panel or longitudinal
    data), and

-   any **restrictions** (e.g. ethical concerns, limitation on
    collecting data).
:::
::::

## Some sampling types

::::::: columns
:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: callout-note
## Simple random sampling

Every unit in the population has the same sample probability to be
drawn.

![](images/lecture-02/art01.png){width="60%" fig-align="center"}
:::
::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}
::: callout-note
## Stratified random sampling

Units are drawn from non-overlapping sub-populations.

![](images/lecture-02/art03.png){width="60%" fig-align="center"}
:::
::::
:::::::

## Sampling strategies

:::: callout-note
## Sampling strategies combine knowledge about the population with statistical methods.

For example:

::: incremental
-   designing so your sample estimates give (theoretically) unbiased
    estimates of the population parameters,
-   sample so the data will be representative of the subpopulations
    (e.g. stratified random sampling), or
-   oversampling or undersampling to compensate for imbalance in
    classes.
:::
::::

::: {.callout-warning style="width:60%; background-color:white;"}
![](images/lecture-02/art03.png){width="40%" style="float:left;"} What
might go wrong with a simple random sampling of 10 creatures from this
population?
:::

## Random and non-random selections

Units (population members) ideally are sampled *randomly*, but often
selections are made in a non-random manner.

::: callout-warning
## Example

If I survey every 10th household in a street, is that a random
selection?
:::

::: callout-warning
## Important

What do you think can go wrong if we don't sample randomly?
:::

## What's wrong with these examples?

::: callout-note
## Breakout Session: Discussion

1.  You want to know the attitude of the creatures aboout working at
    home.

    *So you call phone numbers listed in the order of telephone
    directory and stop when you have 20 observations.*


2.  You want to get the hair count distribution of the Planet Cute
    Creatures population.
    
    *So you sample creatures from the Society of Bald
    Extraterrestrials.*
    
3. Items 1 and 2 are toy examples. Do you know of any examples of bad sample design in the real world?

# Data Collection {background-color="#006DAE"}

## Reality of data collection 

::: {.callout-note style="background-color:white;"}
## <span style="color:#E61E2A;">Designing a data collection is **_hard_**</span>.

::: {.incremental}

* There may be unknown or hidden structures in the population.

* It may add complex structural elements, e.g.
    * Cross-sectional, repeated cross-sectional (e.g. case-control), 
    * Panel or longitudinal (e.g. cohort studies), and so on.
    * Clusters or hierarchies (e.g. students in schools in states)
      
* You may have introduce unintended or unknown structures in the data, e.g. confounded variables.
    
* It's further complicated by:
    * Non-response, 
    * Missing data, 
    * Mis-measured data, 
    * Dropouts, and censoring,
    * ..... ðŸ˜±

## Observational Studies

::: {.callout-note} 
## Observational Studies

::: incremental 

* Sampling from a population typically yields data considered to be an [**observational studies**]{style="color:#004C9F;"}. 

* Almost all open data are from observational studies.

* An **observational study** aims to draw inferences about a population from a sample where independent variables are *not* intentionally allocated to units within the sample for the purpose of a study.

* Data considered in observational studies are **observational data**.

:::

:::

## Examples of Observational Studies

::: {.callout-tip}

* <span style="color:#880E4F;">Who will win the 2022 Australian federal election?</span>
* <span style="color:#0277BD;">Survey households</span>

:::

::: {.callout-tip}

* <span style="color:#880E4F;">Where are the best schools?</span>
* <span style="color:#0277BD;">Government administrative data</span>

:::

::: {.callout-tip}

* <span style="color:#880E4F;">Who is buying my products?</span>
* <span style="color:#0277BD;">Customer database</span>

:::

## Experimental studies

::: {.callout-note}
## Experimental studies 

* A scientific claim generally needs to be validated by an [**experimental study**]{style="color:#004C9F;"}.

* In an **experimental study**, a causal variable of interest (referred to as *treatment*) is administered to recipients while holding other covariates at controlled settings to observe responses.

* Data from an experiment are referred to as **experimental data**.

:::

## Examples

::: {.callout-tip style="background-color:white;"}

* <span style="color:#880E4F;">Is the vaccine effective against flu?</span>
* <span style="color:#0277BD;">The data of whether the person who was administered the vaccine or placebo caught the flu afterwards.</span>

:::

::: {.callout-tip style="background-color:white;"}

* <span style="color:#880E4F;">Which fertiliser brand is most effective for wheat yield?</span>
* <span style="color:#0277BD;">Yield data from crop field trial with plots treated with one of the three fertiliser brands.</span>

:::

::: {.callout-tip style="background-color:white;"}

* <span style="color:#880E4F;">Does the A/B website design affect customer purchase rates?</span>
* <span style="color:#0277BD;">Purchase data from an experiment where customers were randomly shown either version A or B of the website.</span>

:::


## Experimental units
::: {.callout-note style="background-color:white;"}

**Experimental units** are recipients of the allocated treatment such that no sub-division of it can receive another treatment independently.

* For the fertiliser example: The experimental units are the plots of land (fields) receiving different fertilisers.

* For the vaccine example: The experimental units are the individual patients who receive either vaccine or placebo.

* In the A/B testing example: The experimental units are the individual website visitors who see version A or B.

:::

## Observational units
::: {.callout-note style="background-color:white;"}

**Observational units** are units that you measure the response on.

* For the fertiliser example: The observational units are the same plots of land where wheat yield is measured.

* For the vaccine example: The observational units are the same individual patients whose flu status is observed.

* In the A/B testing example: The observational units are the same website visitors whose purchasing behavior is tracked.

:::

## Observational Units 

<br><br>

::: {.callout-warning style="background-color:white;"}
## Note

- *Observational unit* is not the *observation* (the response)! The wheat yield, flu status, and purchase decisions are the observations, not the observational units.
    
- Sometimes the experimental units *are the same as* the observational units, as in these examples.

:::

## Concept check 

::: {.callout-warning style="background-color:white;"}

* Prof Android delivers their lecture by reciting word-to-word from the text in a monotone. 

* Prof Alien delivers their lecture by transmitting the information directly to the students mind.

* You want to see if one of the methods is more effective. 

* Students in class 1, 3, 4, 7 and 10 have Prof Android.

* Students in class 2, 5, 6, 8 and 9 have Prof Alien.

:::

## Example: french fries (hot chips)

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

::: callout-note 
## Study details 

* The **treatment** is oil, and there are 3 of them.

* The **experimental units** are batches of chips. 

* The **observational units** are the tasters.

* **Replication** is the two batches of each oil for each week. 

* Weeks could be considered to be **blocks**, because the taste might change as the oil ages.

* The **outcome** or measured variable is the rating factor. There are five taste factors recorded. 

* **Randomisation** applied to order of tasting (probably), but tasters should be **blind** to the type of oil. 

:::

:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

![](images/lecture-02/hot-chip.png){width="80%"}

:::

:::


## Systematic Design of Experiments

**Randomisation** is applied to order of tasting (probably).

::: callout-caution 

::: {.incremental}
* Why don't we order the treatments in a **systematic order**?

* Isn't this easier to manage the experiment?

* Systematic designs are prone to [**bias**]{style="color:#004C9F;"} and [**confounding**]{style="color:#004C9F;"}.

:::

:::

## Randomisation

::: callout-note
## Treatments 

* Treatments should be allocated *randomly* to experimental units. 

This avoids:

:::incremental 

  * [**systematic bias**]{style="color:#004C9F;"} - e.g. all flu vaccine A tested in January (summer) and all flu vaccine B tested in July (winter).
  
  * [**selection bias**]{style="color:#004C9F;"} - e.g. giving the treatment that you are testing to the sick patients and placebo to those that are healthy.
  
  * [**other bias**]{style="color:#004C9F;"} - e.g. the lab technician giving the treatment to the first rat that is taken out of the cage. 
  
:::

:::

## Blocking

[**Blocks**]{style="color:#004C9F;"} are used to group the experimental units into alike units.

::: {.callout-note}
## Blocking 

::: {.incremental}

* If well done, blocking can lower the variance of treatment contrasts which increase power.

* A non-homogeneous block (i.e. units within block are *not* alike) can decrease the power of the experiment.

* You can form blocks from **Natural discrete divisions** between experimental units.  
*e.g. in experiments with people, the gender and age groups makes an obvious block.*

* Grouping experimental units with similar **continuous gradients**.  
*e.g., if the experiment is spread out in time or space and there exists no obvious natural boundaries, then an arbitrary boundary may be chosen to group experimental units that are contiguous in time or space.*

## The Salk Vaccine Field Trial

::: callout-note 
## Salk Vaccine Field Trial

* The first polio epidemic hit the United States in 1916 claiming hundreds of thousands of victims, especially children.

* National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) was ready to test the vaccine developed by Jonas Salk in the real world.

* A controlled experiment was proposed to test the effectiveness of the vaccine on grade 1, 2 and 3 children at selected school districts though the country where the risk of polio was high.

* In total two million children were involved although not all parents consented to their children to be vaccinated.

## Trial Design 

:::{.columns}
:::{.column width="45%"}

:::callout-note 
## Design for the NFIP Study

Vaccinate all grade 2 children whose parents would consent, leaving children in grades 1 and 3 as controls.

* *Can grade 2 children whose parents did not consent be included as control?*

* *What are the potential issues with such a design?*

* *Polio is a contact disease. Would incidences of disease be higher in grade 2?*

:::

:::
::: {.column width="45%"}

::: callout-note
## Randomised controlled trial

An alternate vaccine trial randomly assigned the vaccine and placebo to children.

:::

:::

:::

## Some study details

:::callout-note 
## Details

* The rate is the number of polio cases per 100,000 in each group.

* RCT and NFIP trial sampled from school districts with similar exposures to the polio virus.

* Groups labelled with Not Vaccination (no consent), Control and Placebo group did not receive the vaccine. 

::: 

::: callout-tip
## Results

Let's take a look at the results now - Why is the rate of polio cases different?

:::

## Vaccine Results

::: {.columns}

::: {.column}

| Group | Participants | Rate |
|:------|------------:|-----:|
| Vaccinated (Grade 2) | 221,998 | 25 |

| Not Vaccination<br> (Grade 2, no consent) | 123,605 | 44 |
| Incomplete Vaccination<br>(Grade 2, incomplete) | 9,904 | 40 |

| Vaccinated | 200,745 | 28 |
| Placebo | 201,229 | 71 |
| Not Vaccination<br>(no consent) | 338,778 | 46 |
| Incomplete Vaccination | 8,484 | 24 |

: Randomised controlled trial

:::

:::

## Possible explanations

:::callout-tip 

::: {.incremental}
* Higher income parents would more likely consent to treatment than lower-income parents.

* Children of higher income parents are more vulnerable to polio.

* Many forms of polio are hard to diagnose and in borderline cases.

:::

:::


## Limitations in (social) experiments

:::callout-caution 
## Think about

* Cooperation needed from participants 
* Ethical objections
* Substitution bias 
* Sample attrition 
* Hawthorne effect

::: 

:::  callout-warning

Basically, designing and running experiments are *hard*.

## Taxonomy of types of data studies

:::callout-note
## Types

:::incremental

- **Experimental data**: the gold standard of data collection, but very difficult

- **Observational data**:
    - **census**: all (or close to all) members of the population are measured
    - **survey sample**: each member of the population has a known probability of being selected into the sample, eg cohort study, cross-sectional, case-control, cluster/hierarchical, multi-stage
    - **non-random sample**: it is not known how the sample relates to the population
    - **censored**: events might happen outside of observation interval, eg observed up to 30,000km but brake failure was at 45,000 km
    - **occurrences**: only when an incident is observed is it recorded, eg wildlife sightings, warranty claims, complaints
