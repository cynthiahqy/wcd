Dear Students,

I've been working on to improving our unit materials by converting them from .Rmd to .qmd format. 

However after significant effort, I've realised this conversion process is more time-intensive than anticipated and is diverting resources from other unit priorities. 

For the next few weeks, we'll be using the current .Rmd files rather than continuing with .qmd  conversion. This means you will need to access the Seminar slides from the Moodle.

If you have any questions about accessing the unit resources, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Thank you for your understanding,

Kate
